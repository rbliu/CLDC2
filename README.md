# Plotting Shear Distribution of Background Galaxies in DC2 Run 1.1p extra-galactic catalog (protoDC2)

In this Hack Day project, we are aiming to plot shear distribution of background galaxies which are distorted by the corresponding host halos. We hope that it can help us to find the more massive halos.

Participants: **Ian Dell'Antonio**, **Robert Liu**, **Shenming Fu**

__Objectives__:

1. Access extra galactic catalog (ProtoDC2) through the GCR.
2. Select galaxy cluster centrals as a proxy for clusters.
3. Select background galaxies filtered by position and redshift.
4. Plotting tangential shear of the background galaxies vs. their distances to the host halo center.


__Logistics__: 

* The notebooks demonstrated in this repository are based on the Generic Catalog Reader (GCR, https://github.com/yymao/generic-catalog-reader).

* The notebooks are intended to be run through the JupyterHub NERSC interface available here: https://jupyter-dev.nersc.gov. To setup your NERSC environment, please follow the instructions available here: https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Using+Jupyter-dev+at+NERSC
